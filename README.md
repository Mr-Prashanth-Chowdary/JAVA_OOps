Classes and Objects: Understanding the basics of classes, objects, constructors, and instance variables.
Inheritance: Demonstrating how to create subclasses, override methods, and leverage the 'super' keyword.
Polymorphism: Showing how to implement polymorphism through interfaces and method overriding.
Encapsulation: Emphasizing the importance of data hiding and using access modifiers.
Abstraction: Exploring abstract classes and interfaces for creating abstract structures.
Composition: Illustrating how to design complex objects by composing simpler objects.
Exception Handling: Dealing with exceptions using try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.
